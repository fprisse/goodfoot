<p>Strategy is the art of defining what you want to be before others tell you what you are, or, even worse, tell you what you should be and are not. The right strategy is one of the few things that are not for sale, or as Porter has put it: "Of course strategy is hard - it's about making tough choices" What we can do for you is facilitate the process of defining your strategy with:</p>

<UL>
<LI>Input based on a solid business understanding and analysis
<LI>A simple idea that encompasses your ambitions and goals
<LI>Methodology for testing your ideas
</UL>

<p>The main theme in this should be to define a strategy that differentiates rather than competes. Thriving to beat your competitors along measures that have been set by comparative analysis makes no sense, you cannot become best in class by copying somebody's work. One should thrive to be copied and thus set the goalposts for an industry. A good idea, clear goals, a mission and, if poetically formulated, even a vision is one thing. What counts however is how it is effected. We can assist dedicated teams in aligning your business with your strategy by:</p>

<UL>
<LI>Developing operational strategies
<LI>Portfolio optimisation (product, client, prospects)
<LI>Revising business models
<LI>Partner selection
</UL>

<p>In short: defining and communicating the way forward in terms that answer the question: "What does it mean for business today?"</p>
